### Decisions
#### Architecture

The architecture of this project was made by applying TDD and concepts from DDD (domain driven design). The idea is to have a decoupled architecture. That is why the core service is framework agnostic. Moreover, every service is injectable, even the ORM and database.
The database can be replaced by modifying the ORM service without having to modify the rest of the code.( If interfaces are followed).

The app is splitted into three different services:
- Session ( manages sessions and okens)
- Game (manages game data, create new game, view games, updated games, save, restore)
- User (manages User data, login, register)

#### Language

Typescript was selected because of its interoperability with backend and frontend and its safety regarding stacic type checks.

#### Database

The database selected was postgres because It is easy to use and deploy with docker.

#### Framework

TSED was selected because of it's lightweightness, its decorators and its native object oriented concepts such as injecting services.

#### Deployment

Heroku was selected as cloud provider because it is really easy to use, with Procfile written the rest of the job is automatically done.

### Postman

A postman collection is stored in documentation folder. By importing the collecting it is possible to
see examples of how to do the different kind of requests. You can find it here /documentation/PROD_Collection_á¹”ostman.json .

### How to run tests locally:
Create a .env file by copy and pasting .envdevcopy file content. Use the testing variable.
```
chmod 711 ./uptests.sh
./uptests.sh
npm install && npm run test
```

### How to run the app locally:
Create a .env file by copy and pasting .envdevcopy file content. Use the dev variable.
```
chmod 711 ./up.sh
./up.sh
npm install && npm start
```

### How to deploy (dev notes)
With changes, commit them and do:
```
git push heroku master
```

### DataStructure

### Testing

- The core application service is tested with Integration testing, to make sure the core application service remains working properly after applying new changes.
- Integration testing is also implemented to test the whole api through rest requests.

### Code formatter and Standards

- ESLint
- Typescript
- Prettier

### Security
Security things that can be improved.

Passwords are not being stored. It is being stored the hash of a password + random salt (10 rounds). Then when the user try to log in the only thing checked is that the hash applying the same function is the same.

- JWT and sessions must be implemented to improve the authorizations. Also cognito would be useful to avoid storing the password in the database.
- Token expiration also can be applied by using cognito.
- JSON validators may be applied to validate proper data input. AJV or Yup may be good choices.

### Improvements
Things that can be improved.

- Add frontend
- Add swagger

### Exercise

API test

We ask that you complete the following challenge to evaluate your development skills. Please use the programming language and framework discussed during your interview to accomplish the following task.

PLEASE DO NOT FORK THE REPOSITORY. WE NEED A PUBLIC REPOSITORY FOR THE REVIEW. 

## The Game
Develop the classic game of [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game))

## Show your work

1.  Create a Public repository ( please dont make a pull request, clone the private repository and create a new plublic one on your profile)
2.  Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.

## What to build
The following is a list of items (prioritized from most important to least important) we wish to see:
* Design and implement  a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
* Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API
* When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
* Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
* Detect when game is over
* Persistence
* Time tracking
* Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
* Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
* Ability to support multiple users/accounts
 
## Deliverables we expect:
* URL where the game can be accessed and played (use any platform of your preference: heroku.com, aws.amazon.com, etc)
* Code in a public Github repo
* README file with the decisions taken and important notes

## Time Spent
You need to fully complete the challenge. We suggest not spending more than 3 days total.  Please make commits as often as possible so we can see the time you spent and please do not make one commit.  We will evaluate the code and time spent.
 
What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is sufficient to solve everything.

Please email your solution as soon as you have completed the challenge or the time is up
